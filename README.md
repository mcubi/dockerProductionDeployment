# GENERAL DOCUMENTATION OF THIS PROCESS (IT WILL BE BRIEF CAUSE OF I'M LATE)
## FIRST PART: DEV STAGE.
### For this primal stage we must dockerize the application in some parts as a dev environment. For that I will be using 'Docker Compose' -> [ .yaml and dockerfile ]
### dockerfile:

### .yaml:

### The list of the requirements was missing in the original project, so I had to create it:

### End of the DEV STAGE!.
